      BrainJS is a unique platform designed to intelligently streamline your codebase by identifying and merging similar
      elements - such as functions, types, constants, colors, and more — with just a click. Unlike other tools, BrainJS
      has a holistic understanding of your entire codebase, enabling precise, context-aware merging that maintains
      consistency and minimizes redundancy across your project.
